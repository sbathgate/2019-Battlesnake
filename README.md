# majorMedeiros 3rd Place 2019 Beginner Battlesnake

A simple [Battlesnake AI](http://battlesnake.io) written in Python. 

This snake was built using the [https://github.com/battlesnakeofficial/community/blob/master/starter-snakes.md](https://github.com/battlesnakeofficial/community/blob/master/starter-snakes.md) for API documentation and instructions for running your AI.

This AI client uses the [bottle web framework](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/index.html) to serve requests and the [gunicorn web server](http://gunicorn.org/) for running bottle on Heroku. Dependencies are listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).
